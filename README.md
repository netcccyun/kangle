kangle is a lightweight, high-performance web server and reverse proxy with a
built-in web administration console. It provides flexible request/response
access control, virtual hosting, memory and disk caching, and extensible
upstream support.

## Features

- HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and optional HTTP/3
- HTTP, HTTP/2, FastCGI, and AJP upstreams with connection reuse
- Memory cache, disk cache, and partial caching for large objects
- Request and response access-control rules
- Per-virtual-host process and user isolation
- XML configuration and a web administration console
- On-the-fly gzip, Brotli, and Zstandard compression
- DSO extensions, WebDAV, and SQLite-backed virtual-host support

## Requirements

### Debian and Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  git build-essential cmake pkg-config \
  libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libpcre2-dev
```

### Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, RHEL, and Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install -y \
  git gcc gcc-c++ make cmake pkgconf-pkg-config \
  openssl-devel zlib-devel pcre2-devel
```

### CentOS/RHEL 7

The distribution's `cmake` package is too old. Install EPEL's `cmake3` package and use the `cmake3` command when configuring the project:

```bash
sudo yum install -y epel-release
sudo yum install -y \
  git gcc gcc-c++ make cmake3 \
  openssl-devel zlib-devel pcre2-devel
```

## Build from source

Clone the repository recursively; `kasync` and `khttpd` are required
submodules.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cccyun/kangle.git
cd kangle

mkdir cmake-build
cd cmake-build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/vhs/kangle -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j"$(nproc)"
```

On CentOS/RHEL 7, replace `cmake` with `cmake3`:

```bash
cmake3 .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/vhs/kangle -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j"$(nproc)"
```

If the repository was cloned without `--recursive`, initialize the submodules
before configuring:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Build products are placed in the repository's `build/` directory. Check the enabled features with:

```bash
../build/kangle -v
```

## Install and run

Install kangle under `/vhs/kangle`. Set
`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/another/path` during configuration to choose a
different prefix.

```bash
sudo make install
sudo install -d /vhs/kangle/var /vhs/kangle/ext /vhs/kangle/www
sudo cp -n /vhs/kangle/etc/config-default.xml /vhs/kangle/etc/config.xml
```

Review `/vhs/kangle/etc/config.xml` before exposing the server, especially its
listeners and administration credentials. The sample configuration listens on
port 80 and exposes the management interface only on `127.0.0.1:3311`.

```bash
# Start as a daemon
sudo /vhs/kangle/bin/kangle

# Reload configuration gracefully
sudo /vhs/kangle/bin/kangle -r

# Stop the server
sudo /vhs/kangle/bin/kangle -q

# Run in the foreground (useful for containers and diagnostics)
sudo /vhs/kangle/bin/kangle -n -g
```

The project does not currently install a systemd unit. A distribution package
or a local service unit can call the commands above.

## Optional build features

Install the corresponding development package before enabling a system
library. Typical package names are `libbrotli-dev`/`brotli-devel`,
`libzstd-dev`/`libzstd-devel`, `libjemalloc-dev`/`jemalloc-devel`, and
`liburing-dev`/`liburing-devel`.

| Option | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `-DENABLE_BROTLI=ON` | Use the system Brotli libraries |
| `-DBROTLI_DIR=/path/to/brotli` | Build Brotli from a source tree |
| `-DENABLE_ZSTD=ON` | Use the system Zstandard library |
| `-DZSTD_DIR=/path/to/zstd` | Build Zstandard from a source tree |
| `-DENABLE_JEMALLOC=ON` | Link with the system jemalloc library |
| `-DLINUX_IOURING=ON` | Enable Linux io_uring support |
| `-DHTTP_PROXY=ON` | Build a proxy-focused variant |
| `-DENABLE_DISK_CACHE=OFF` | Disable disk-cache support |
| `-DENABLE_HTTP2=OFF` | Disable HTTP/2 support |
| `-DKSOCKET_SSL=OFF` | Build without TLS support |

For example, to build a release with the system Brotli and Zstandard
libraries:

```bash
cmake .. \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/vhs/kangle \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DENABLE_BROTLI=ON \
  -DENABLE_ZSTD=ON
make -j"$(nproc)"
```

## HTTP/3 build

HTTP/3 requires both BoringSSL and LSQUIC source trees. Keep them outside the
kangle repository and pass their absolute or relative paths to CMake. LSQUIC
also has its own platform build dependencies; install those before configuring
kangle.

```bash
mkdir kangle-http3 && cd kangle-http3
git clone --recursive https://github.com/google/boringssl.git
git clone --recursive https://github.com/litespeedtech/lsquic.git
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cccyun/kangle.git

cd kangle
mkdir cmake-build && cd cmake-build
cmake .. \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/vhs/kangle \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DBORINGSSL_DIR=../../boringssl \
  -DLSQUIC_DIR=../../lsquic
make -j"$(nproc)"
```

Passing `LSQUIC_DIR` alone is not sufficient; the current build enables
LSQUIC only when `BORINGSSL_DIR` is also set.

## Test suite

The integration tests require **Go 1.22 or newer** and download Go modules on
the first build. Build kangle first, then run:

```bash
cd test
./build.sh
./test.sh
```

The test runner starts local listeners and helper processes, so make sure its
test ports are not already in use.
